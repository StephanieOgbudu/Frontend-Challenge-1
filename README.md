# Frontend-Challenge-1

Hello guys,

I have decided to start a **FrontEnd Mentor challenge**.
Below is the link: [Front End Mentor](https://beta.frontendmentor.io/)

This is focused on a Huddle Landing Page with a single introductory section.
This was built using HTML & CSS
(P.S - the responsive section was built by me)

Kindly check it out and see if it is satisfactory, you can also make suggestions and make changes on the repo.

Thank you guys.
